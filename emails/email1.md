Have you tried to learn how to code a Node application with Express and MongoDB, but failed miserably in the process? 

Well, I did :(

It was incredibly hard for me to pick up this stack at first because I didn't start with any computing background. Many server-side concepts just went over my head when I tried to find out more about them. I also had a hard time understanding documentations for both Express and MongoDB, probably because of my weak fundamentals. 

Now, I finally understood what these things are, and how to code effectively with them. Hence, I decided to write a comprehensive tutorial so you won't have to go through the same headache I did when I first started. 

If you have been on the fence about making an application with Node, Express and MongoDB, I highly recommend you check out this article I've written. I think you'll love it :)

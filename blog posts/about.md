# About

Do any of the following experiences sound familiar to you?

- **What should I learn or do** to become a better developer?
- I don't know where to start, there's so much information out there!
- I've been **googling forever** and I still can't find a solution to my problems!
- I know I must be doing something wrong, but **how can I make these error messages go away**?!
- Am I doing this correctly? Is there a better way?

You're not alone.

I went through the same experiences when I learned to design and code over the years. It was tough when I started.

I've had my fair share of pain. That's why I created this website â€“ to **share things I learned about designing and coding** so you don't have to struggle and stumble like I did.

## What you can find here

You'll mostly find **tutorials about frontend and backend development** (mostly HTML, CSS and JavaScript related). Occasionally, you'll also hear me talk about design, marketing and lessons I learned from experiencing life.

People who followed me so far were kind enough to say some awesome things about my work:

<blockquote>I love Zell's articles. They're simple, easy to understand and straight to the point.<cite>Sai Charan</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Zell's writing style, content, and thoroughness is fantastic. I've been around long enough (20 years) to remember that getting expert, well written, and thorough help on new topics was just about hopeless. The small percentage of people like Zell who go out and become experts on topics and then work hard to teach others like me are the reason that software these days is so much easier and fun to write.<cite>Eric Gaut</cite>
</blockquote>

In addition to writing here, I have also written for amazing publications like *CSS Tricks*, *Sitepoint* and *Smashing Magazine*. Just to add one more bit to the credentials soup, I've also *spoken at CSSConf.Asia*.

## A little more about me

I started learning to design and code when I was 25. It was incredibly difficult at first because I had no background in design or development. I came from Finance.

I often got stuck since I was weak in my fundamentals. I'd find myself spending hours reading stackoverflow answers and tutorials on other blogs to try and overcome my problems.

Life's not rosy, unfortunately. It's tough to find good answers and tutorials. Most articles out there are either too high-level, or too beginner-oriented. Not many articles focus on applying concepts to a real-world situation.

I got so fed-up that I started writing soon after. I wrote tutorials that I wish I could have read. Tutorials that were so easy to understand that a beginner could apply things that were taught immediately.

I also wrote tutorials that were practical. I wrote about things I learned, and how to apply them in a real-world context, which you don't see very much of on the net still. 

If my story and what I offer sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to look at where to go next.

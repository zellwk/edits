## CRUD - UPDATE

The **UPDATE** operation, like **CREATE**, can only be triggered by browsers through a special request. For updates, we use a **PUT** request. 

Since we've already covered how to send data to the server using the `<form>` element, we'll switch around and send JSON data through **PUT** request this time. 

Update => Edit 

- Add bodyparser 
- Add JavaScript 
- Add "Change last item"

## CRUD - DELETE

Delete

Note: This, of course, isn't the best example. We could create single page apps with JavaScript so we don't force users to refresh their browsers whenever there is a need to perform CRUD operations.

It however, forms a good base for those who are starting out with the backend side of things.
